## User Feedback for XYZ Reader To Be Used for Improvements:

### Lyla says:
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

### Jay says:
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

### Kagure says:
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
